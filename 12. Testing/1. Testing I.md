# Testing I - JS Testing 101

- _"Tests need to be super fast as we'll be running hundreds or even thousands of them on our code"._

- Basic input output (expect()...toeBe())
- Basic: toEqual()
- Mocking Library Behaviour
  - `__mocks__` folder
  - `jest.mock` in test file
  - _"Moment.JS is an example of a library that would need to be mocked as the outputs change regularly"._
- Testing Error Throws
  - Wrap in callback before chaining `.toThrow()`
  - `expect(fn).toThrow()`
- Testing Asynchronous Code
  - `jest.runAllTimers()`
  - Testing resolve & reject
  - `jest.advanceTimersByTime(<milliseconds>)`
