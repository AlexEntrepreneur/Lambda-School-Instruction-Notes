# Querying Data, Migrations & Seeding

## Querying Data Using `JOIN`
**Joining Tables?**
- We can combine tables together to create useful views and reports.
- _This is a useful skill for many business that need to gain insights from their data._
- For example, we could have a `customers` table that contains customers and their orders, and a `salespersons` table that contains a list of salespeople at the company, and the two tables could be connected via an `orders` **connecting table** that contains solely **foreign keys** that connect both tables via references. **This is a good example of where we would use `JOIN`.**

**JOIN Types**  
There are different types of joins that we can use to produce the data outcomes that we require.
- _"It is good to use aliasing to make your queries more clear as they increase in size"_
  - To do this we use the `AS` keyword:

```sql
SELECT <alias1>.id, <alias2> FROM customers,
FROM Table1 AS <alias1>
JOIN Table2 AS <alias2>
```

**INNER JOIN**  

![alt text](./assets/INNER_JOIN.png)  
- If we don't specify the type of `JOIN`, `JOIN` will be `INNER JOIN` by default.
- An `INNER JOIN` will return all of the records in the left table (table A) that have a matching record in the right table (table B).

```sql
SELECT <select_list>
FROM Table_A A
INNER JOIN Table_B B
ON A.Key = B.Key
```

**LEFT JOIN**  

![alt text](./assets/LEFT_JOIN.png)  
- A `LEFT JOIN` will return all of the records in Table A, plus any common rows in Table B.
  - This mean that in our query the order of the tables referenced matters.
  - If we want to see the NULL values of a specific table when joining, we specify it first after the `FROM` keyword:

```sql
SELECT <select_list>
FROM Table_A A
LEFT JOIN Table_B B
ON A.Key = B.Key
```

**RIGHT JOIN**  

![alt text](./assets/RIGHT_JOIN.png)  
- A `RIGHT JOIN` will return all rows in Table A, plus any common rows in Table B.

```sql
SELECT <select_list>
FROM Table_A A
RIGHT JOIN Table_B B
ON A.Key = B.Key
```

**FULL OUTER JOIN**  

![alt text](./assets/FULL_OUTER_JOIN.png)  
- A full outer join will return the union of Table A and Table B, i.e. all the rows in A and all the rows in B. If something in A doesn't have a corresponding datum in B, then the B portion is null, and vice versa.
- _Note: There is no_ `FULL OUTER JOIN` _in MySQL._

```sql
SELECT <select_list>
FROM Table_A A
FULL OUTER JOIN Table_B B
ON A.Key = B.Key
```

**Excluding Joins**
- We can exclude certain values by using `WHERE`...

## Database Migration
- Let's say we have built a cool MVP project and successfully deployed it. What happens when we want to add a new feature that affects the structure of the database?
- This is where we use automated migrations!

**Migrating With Knex**
- When we run a migration script we create a new version of the a table from the current version.
- So we can initialise a DB by running `knex init`
- This is configured in our `down` scripts
- _"NEVER ROLL BACK IN PRODUCTION! You will be destroying live data"._
- _"In your dev team, when having problems with your database, check whether you are on the latest migration. This is a VERY common mistake that every back end developer will make"._

**Initialise Knex Config**  
- Add initialisation script in `package.json`.
```json
"scripts": {
  "initDB": "knex init"
}
```
```bash
$ yarn run initDB
```

- Then set up config file in `knexfile.js`:
```js
development: {
    client: 'sqlite3',
    useNullAsDefault: true,
    connection: {
      filename: './database/<filename>.sqlite3'
    },
    migrations: {
      directory: './database/migrations'
    },
    seeds: {
      directory: './database/seeds'
    }
}
```

- `useNullAsDefault` does x, y, and z.

- Then import your knex configuration file in your router file:
```js
const knexConfig = require('./knexfile');
const db = knex(knexConfig.development);
```

**Generating Seed Files**  
- We can generate a seed file by running the following command:  
```bash
$ yarn run knex seed:make <filename>
```  
- _This is because knex is not installed globally on our machine so we run it through yarn or npm_

- We can also add the commands as scripts in our `package.json`:
```json
"scripts": {
    "create-seed1": "knex seed:make <filename>",
    "create-seed2": "knex seed:make <filename>"
}
```
- Executing the scripts:
```bash
$ yarn run create-seed1;
$ yarn run create-seed2;
```


**Generating Migration Files**  
- We can generate a scaffolding of a migration file by running the following command:  
```bash
$ yarn run knex migrate:make <filename>
```

- We can also add these commands as scripts in our `package.json` if we prefer:
```json
"scripts": {
    "create-table1": "knex migrate:make <filename>",
    "create-table2": "knex migrate:make <filename>"
}
```
- Executing the script:
```bash
$ yarn run create-table1;
$ yarn run create-table2;
```

**Configuring Migration Files**  
- Knex generates your migrate file populated with boilerplate:

```js
exports.up = function(knex, Promise) {
  // Migrate code
};
exports.down = function(knex, Promise) {
  // Rollback code
};
```
- Then we add our initial table configuration using regular Knex syntax:

```js
exports.up = function(knex, Promise) {
  return knex.schema.createTable("cohorts", function(table) {
    table.increments(); // pass a column name to rename "id" column
    table.string("name", 255).notNullable();
  });
};

exports.down = function(knex, Promise) {
  return knex.schema.dropTableIfExists("cohorts");
};
```

**Initialising Migration Files**  
- We can create the database from the migration files by running the following command:
```bash
$ yarn run knex migrate:latest
```
- We can also add these commands as scripts in our `package.json` if we prefer:
```json
"scripts": {
    "migrate": "knex migrate:latest",
    "rollback": "knex migrate:rollback"
}
```
- Executing the script:
```bash
$ yarn run migrate
```

**Adding Seed Data To The Database**  
- We can add the seed data to the database from the seed files by running the following command:
```bash
$ yarn run knex seed:run
```
- We can also add this command as scripts in our `package.json` if we prefer:
```json
"scripts": {
    "seed": "knex seed:run"
}
```
- Executing the script:
```bash
$ yarn run seed
```
