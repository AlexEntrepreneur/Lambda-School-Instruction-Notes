# Querying Data, Migrations & Seeding

## Querying Data Using `JOIN`
**Joining Tables?**
- We can combine tables together to create useful views and reports.
- _This is a useful skill for many business that need to gain insights from their data._
- For example, we could have a `customers` table that contains customers and their orders, and a `salespersons` table that contains a list of salespeople at the company, and the two tables could be connected via an `orders` **connecting table** that contains solely **foreign keys** that connect both tables via references. **This is a good example of where we would use `JOIN`.**

**JOIN Types**  
There are different types of joins that we can use to produce the data outcomes that we require.
- _"It is good to use aliasing to make your queries more clear as they increase in size"_
  - To do this we use the `AS` keyword:

```
SELECT <alias1>.id, <alias2> FROM customers,
FROM Table1 AS <alias1>
JOIN Table2 AS <alias2>
```

**INNER JOIN**

- If we don't specify the type of `JOIN`, `JOIN` will be `INNER JOIN` by default.
- An `INNER JOIN` will return all of the records in the left table (table A) that have a matching record in the right table (table B).

```
SELECT <select_list>
FROM Table_A A
INNER JOIN Table_B B
ON A.Key = B.Key
```

**LEFT JOIN**  

![alt text](/assets/LEFT_JOIN.png)  
- A `LEFT JOIN` will return all of the records in Table A, plus any common rows in Table B.
  - This mean that in our query the order of the tables referenced matters.
  - If we want to see the NULL values of a specific table when joining, we specify it first after the `FROM` keyword:

```
SELECT <select_list>
FROM Table_A A
LEFT JOIN Table_B B
ON A.Key = B.Key
```

**RIGHT JOIN**  

![alt text](/assets/RIGHT_JOIN.png)  
- A `RIGHT JOIN` will return all rows in Table A, plus any common rows in Table B.

```
SELECT <select_list>
FROM Table_A A
RIGHT JOIN Table_B B
ON A.Key = B.Key
```

**FULL OUTER JOIN**  

![alt text](/assets/FULL_OUTER_JOIN.png)  
- A full outer join will return the union of Table A and Table B, i.e. all the rows in A and all the rows in B. If something in A doesn't have a corresponding datum in B, then the B portion is null, and vice versa.
- _Note: There is no FULL OUTER JOIN in MySQL_

```
SELECT <select_list>
FROM Table_A A
FULL OUTER JOIN Table_B B
ON A.Key = B.Key
```

**Excluding Joins**
- We can exclude certain values by using `WHERE`...

## Database Migration
- Let's say we have built a cool MVP project and successfully deployed it. What happens when we want to add a new feature that affects the structure of the database?
- This is where we use automated migrations!

**Migrating With Knex**
- When we run a migration script we create a new version of the a table from the current version.
- So we can initialise a DB by running `knex init`
- This is configured in our `down` scripts
- _"NEVER ROLL BACK IN PRODUCTION! You will be destroying live data"._
- _"In your dev team, when having problems with your database, check whether you are on the latest migration. This is a VERY common mistake that every back end developer will make"._

**Generating Migration Files**
```
"scripts": {
  "table1": "knex migrate:make createTable1",
  "table2": "knex migrate:make createTable2"
}
```

**Adding Migration & Rollback Commands**
```
"scripts": {
  "table1": "knex migrate:make createTable1",
  "table2": "knex migrate:make createTable2",
  "migrate": "knex migrate:latest",
  "rollback": "knex migrate:rollback"
}
```

**Generating Seed Files**
```
"scripts": {
  "table1": "knex migrate:make createTable1",
  "table2": "knex migrate:make createTable2",
  "migrate": "knex migrate:latest",
  "rollback": "knex migrate:rollback"
  "seed1": "knex seed:make table1File",
  "seed2": "knex seed:make table2File"
}
```

**Adding Seeding Commands**
```
"scripts": {
  "table1": "knex migrate:make createTable1",
  "table2": "knex migrate:make createTable2",
  "migrate": "knex migrate:latest",
  "rollback": "knex migrate:rollback"
  "seed1": "knex seed:make table1File",
  "seed2": "knex seed:make table2File",
  "seed": "knex seed:run"
}
```
